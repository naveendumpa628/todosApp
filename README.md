Objective:
Develop a Todo Web Application where users can manage their daily tasks by storing
them and updating their status. The application should support user authentication, task
management, and profile management.
The Technologies you need to use are:-
1. ReactJS (Frontend)
2. Nodejs, Express for backend API
3. JWT for authentication
4. UUID for generating a unique ID
5. SQLite3 or MongoDB for Database management
Functional Requirements:
1. User Authentication:
○ Implement a Signup feature where new users can register by providing the
necessary details.
○ Implement a Login feature where registered users can authenticate
themselves using JWT tokens.
○ Secure the API routes by validating the JWT token to ensure that only
authenticated users can access certain features.
2. Todo Management:
○ Implement Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations for managing
daily tasks.
○ Allow users to add new tasks, view their list of tasks, edit existing tasks,
and delete tasks they no longer need.
○ Enable users to update the status of each task. The available statuses
should include "done," "pending," "in progress," and "completed."
3. User Profile Management:
○ Implement CRUD operations to manage the user’s profile.
○ Allow users to update their profile information, such as name, email, and
password.
○ Ensure that profile updates are only accessible to the authenticated user.
